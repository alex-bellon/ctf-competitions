# RTFM
## Recon, 10 points

## Prompt

I don't have the original prompt, but to be honest I don't remember if there even was one.

## Solution

[RTFM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM) is a common (and kind of dismissive/snarky) acronym in the CS world that stands for "Read The Fucking Manual". People usually use it in response to questions that could easily be answered if you, well, read the manual. I assumed that the flag was in the FAQ on the CTF website, and sure enough it was: `flag{probably_something_snarky_like_"this_is_what_a_flag_looks like"}`.
