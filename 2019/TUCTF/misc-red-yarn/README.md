### Prompt

We like the simple things in life -- this file went back to the basics!

### Solution
Based on the title of the challenge, and the fact that they said this would be "back to basics", I tried running `strings` on the given file:

```shell
â†’ strings DEBUG.COM | grep CTF
TUCTF{D0NT_F0RG3T_TH3_B4S1CS!}
```

Flag: `TUCTF{D0NT_F0RG3T_TH3_B4S1CS!}`.
